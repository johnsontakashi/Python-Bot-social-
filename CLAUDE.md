# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Python-based social media bot project that is currently in its initial stages. The repository contains only a `.gitignore` file at present, indicating this is a fresh project ready for development.

## Technology Stack Notes

- The repository name suggests this is intended to be a Python project (`Python-Bot-social-`)
- The current `.gitignore` file is Node.js-focused, which may need to be updated for Python development
- No dependencies, build system, or project structure has been established yet

## Development Setup (To Be Established)

Since this is a new project, the following will likely need to be set up:

### Python Environment
- Create virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
- Activate environment: `source venv/bin/activate` (Linux/Mac) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (once requirements.txt is created)

### Common Python Project Files to Create
- `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` for dependencies
- `main.py` or similar entry point
- Project structure (e.g., `src/`, `tests/`, etc.)
- Python-specific `.gitignore` entries

## Current State

The project is in its initial state with:
- Git repository initialized
- Node.js-focused `.gitignore` (may need updating for Python)
- No source code, dependencies, or project structure yet

## Recommendations for Initial Development

1. Update `.gitignore` to include Python-specific ignores (e.g., `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, `.env`, `venv/`)
2. Establish project structure based on the intended social media bot functionality
3. Set up virtual environment and dependency management
4. Create initial Python modules for bot functionality
